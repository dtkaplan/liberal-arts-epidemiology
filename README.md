# Epidemiology as a Liberal Arts Course

## Detailed syllabi and readings

### Macalester Fall 2012

* [Detailed schedule](Macalester/Syllabus-Fall-2012.html)
* [Reading reflections](Macalester/ReadingReflections.html).  For many of the readings (found in the syllabus document), students were asked to submit short answers to questions based on the readings.  The reading reflections document contains the collection of questions.
* Estimation problems. Each week, the epi students were asked to make an estimate of some quantity.  Such estimates are called [Fermi problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem); they are back-of-the-envelope calculations which combine relevant quantities that are already known or believed.  The [FermiProblems](FermiProblems.html) document has the collection of problems.  Strategy tips are given in [EstimationEssays](EstimationEssays.html)
* Activities --- in-class group activities
* Notes --- detailed class notes for each day, arranged by date.
* Readings --- copies of readings for the class.  
* Exam questions --- questions of the sort that might be used on exams.  Some of the files are collections.  There are also many `.tex` files with individual questions.
