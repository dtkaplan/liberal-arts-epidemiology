Contrast the Helskinki principle to the informed choice principle.  Is this "ethics creep?"

Estimation Problem 1: Number of Physicians
----------------------
*[22000 doctors](https://moodle.macalester.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=20498&sid=5224&gid=5224&plugin=onlinetext&action=viewpluginassignsubmission&returnaction=grading&returnparams=) A multiplication problem in converting patients per week to an annual basis.
*[708000 doctors](https://moodle.macalester.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=20498&sid=5431&gid=5431&plugin=onlinetext&action=viewpluginassignsubmission&returnaction=grading&returnparams=)  Note 4 doctors per person.
*[600000 doctors and 4000 slots per medical school](https://moodle.macalester.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=20498&sid=4928&gid=4928&plugin=onlinetext&action=viewpluginassignsubmission&returnaction=grading&returnparams=) Using established rates of doctors per 1000 to assess "need."  Medical school estimate doesn't take into account the working life of doctors.
*[200000 slots a year in medical school](https://moodle.macalester.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=20498&sid=5192&gid=5192&plugin=onlinetext&action=viewpluginassignsubmission&returnaction=grading&returnparams=) Note the big career drop out rate.

[AAMC document](https://members.aamc.org/eweb/upload/The%20Complexities%20of%20Physician%20Supply.pdf) See page 11 for fall in number of physicians after Flexner report (175 to 125 per 100000).  Figure 3 on page 12 for number of medical school graduates.  Total physicians, see page 17: about 800000

Linking Exposure and Disease

### An example of risk ratios and population attributable fraction
Research article on [sitting and mortality](http://www.indiana.edu/~k662/articles/role/sit%20mortality%20van%20der%20Ploeg%202012.pdf)
* Work through abstract
* p. 1 Definition of activity [metabolic equivalents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent)
* p. 1 Why "prospective" studies?  How would you do an experiment about "television viewing", "sitting in a car", etc.
* p. 2 Potential confounding variables: sex, age, education level, ...
* p. 2 "All ... analysis were adjusted for sex, age, ...."
* Table 1.  Who sits a lot?  People in poor health.  People with little physical activity.  
* Table 2.  Note "dose/response".  Note consistency across categories.  Oddball: 150-299 mn/wk of physical activity as a low Hazard ration for sitting > 11 hr per day.  But look at the confidence interval.
* Figure.  Activity is good, sitting is bad, for both people in good health and people in bad health.

### Rate ratios versus absolute difference in rate

![Table 5.1](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Table-5-1.png)  

Compare "never smoked" to "current smoker".  Rate ratio is 2.8 = 49.6/17.7.  But the absolute difference in rate is 49.6-17.7 incidence rate per 100,000 person years.

### Relative Risk
Just like rate ratios but based on cumulative incidence.  Example 

![Table 1.2](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Table-1-2.png) 

Another example: examining the affect of an intervention (Calling people to remind them of an immunization): 

![Table 5.2](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Table-5-2.png)

### Relative Risk Reduction

### Attributable Risk

A graphic on attributable risk: 
![Fig 5.1](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Fig-5-1.png) 
Use this to derive the attributable fraction as $latex \frac{RR-1}{RR}$

In the British Doctors Study: [Table 5.4](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Table-5-4.png)

### Population Attributable Risk

Combine the rates of the different groups and compare to the background rate.

### Case Control

Why we do them?  When the incidence/prevalence is very small, so a cohort is not efficient.

What's an "odds"?    From ["Fugue for Tinhorns"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6djgavbp7c)
<blockquote>
I'm pickin' Valentine, 'cause on the morning line <br>
A guy has got him figured at five to nine

Example: Ovarian cancer and oral contraception use: 
![Table 5.6](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Table-5-6.png) 

Example: Bicycle helmets and head injury 
![Table 5.9](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Table-5-9.png)

Why the Odds Ratio Approximates the Relative Risk (when the prevalence/incidence is very small): [Box 5.5](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Box-5-5.png)

Odds Ratios
------------

* Don't reject the odds ratio.  It's needed for logistic regression which is needed to handle confounding.  See paragraph above "Summing Up" in [*Making Sense of Odds Ratios*](http://meds.queensu.ca/medicine/obgyn/pdf/Making.Sense.of.Odds.pdf)
> "... odds ratios are the output of logistic regression [we'll use stratification], a technique often used to control for confounding bias in research analysis.  Adjustment of odds ratios in logistic regression analysis is widely available through software packages. [We do it in Math 155.]  **Properly addressing confounding in research usually trumps concerns regarding odds ratios.**"
* Make decisions based on "Number Needed to Treat" and "Number Needed to Harm".  See [*Down with Odds Ratios*](http://bmj-ebm.highwire.org/content/1/6/164.full.pdf).  Story about [Humira](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalimumab) doubling the risk of lymphoma.  But the risk of lymphoma is small compared to the risk of aggrevation of the disease being treated by Humira.

### Conversion between OR and event rate (ER) and Number Needed to Treat

```{r warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,messages=FALSE,echo=FALSE,results="hide"}
require(mosaic, quietly=TRUE)
```
```{r}
plotFun( log2((1 - ER*(1-OR))/(ER*(1-OR)*(1-ER)))~ OR&ER, 
         OR.lim=c(0.5,0.9), ER.lim=c(0.5, 0.9), main="log2(NNT)")
```
