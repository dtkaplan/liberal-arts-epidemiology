Epidemiology Class Notes 2012-09-18
==================

### News of the Day

* [Health insurance for children of illegal immigrants](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/health/policy/limits-placed-on-immigrants-in-health-care-law.html?_r=1&hp)
* [Medicare restructuring](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/17/grappling-with-details-of-medicare-proposals/?hpw) 
> The restructuring would affect some of the most vulnerable Americans: the elderly, nearly half of whom live on less than $22,000 a year, and who already spend 16 to 22 percent of their income on health care. Many have dementia and other complex medical problems.

I had dinner last night with a person who works at DeLoitte on human resources consulting.  He said that the number for health care is $8000 per person.  The "Affordable Care Act" taxes employers $2000 who fail to provide health insurance.  The remainder, for much of the population, will need to get picked up by the government.

* [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/).  See also the [summary of reportable diseases](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5853a1.htm) 
* [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/en/)  and the [Horn of Africa report](http://www.who.int/diseasecontrol_emergencies/publications/who_hse_gar_dce_2011_3.pdf)

### Using Spreadsheet Software

* [Evolving Document on How to do Calculations in Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f04AHl20X39L9djdPFR7dd973faEo-l8mjDGVWq9bsI/edit)
* [The spreadsheet assignment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dF9pN0g1djdNa3NtWlhwWHVOMGpWTHc)

### Age Adjustment Calculation

[In-class Activity on Standardization and Age Adjustment](http://dtkaplan.github.com/Statistical-Modeling-A-Fresh-Approach/Epidemiology/Activities/age-adjustment.pdf)

### Life Expectancy 

Is medicine improving?  How has life expectancy changed in the last 100 years?

#### Explanation of calculation.  
Central Question: How is it possible to say what the expected life span is of a child born today?

Age specific death rates and the projection of this through a hypothetical population.

[Activity on Life Expectancy](http://dtkaplan.github.com/Statistical-Modeling-A-Fresh-Approach/Epidemiology/Activities/life-table.pdf)
[Spreadsheet implementing the calculation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?authkey=CJe42r0H&key=0Am13enSalO74dGt2b2xpWkQwODk1REw0aEtUcXdWWWc&hl=en&authkey=CJe42r0H#gid=0)

#### Interpretation of Life Expectancy

Deaths at an early age have a strong impact.  [A spreadsheet for investigating](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dDhwWXhkZ0FCalVjOXE4VXBuTTBoNkE#gid=0) Add in extra deaths at different ages to see the effect on life expectancy.  

* [Article about crime statistics](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/us/15crime.html?hp) How much of the difference between blacks and whites for life expectancy at birth is due to homocide?  


* Child mortality measures from EE Table 2.7. \url{{EE5.pdf}}

### Essential Epidemiology Chap 3

* What is a case report?  What is a case series?  Examples: 
    * rubella and congenital cataracts (what's "congenital")?  
    * Oral contraceptives and pulmonary embolism?
    * ''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia in young, previously healthy homosexual men.
* What's a prevalence survey?
* What's a disease registry?
* Sources of data: [ Table 3.2](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Table-3-2.png)
* Death certificate [US Standard Certificate](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/death11-03final-acc.pdf)
    * Describe what happened in the two cases given as examples in the instructions.
    * Note the "common problems in death certification"
* Birth certificate [Barack Obama, II](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/birth-certificate-long-form.pdf)  note how little health data is recorded.
* What's an ecological study?  What is the disadvantage of them?  
    * Example: employment is higher in cities with lots of immigration.  
    * Example: inverse relationship between SAT scores and expenditures.

**Group task**: What are the analogous sources of data in one of these system?  What do you think would be a good source of data?
* education
* the legal system
* the economy
