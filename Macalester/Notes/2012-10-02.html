<ul>
<li>Risk ratio and number needed to treat <a href="Activities/relative-risk-nnt.pdf">handout</a> Students should first do the calculations on their own, then in a small group.  Then we&#39;ll go over them as a class.</li>

<h1>The Great Epidemic</h1>

<ul>
<li>Show Google Map of Haskell County, Kansas.

<ul>
<li>why the green circles?</li>
<li>why would an epidemic start in a rural area?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>p. 94  newspaper report of sicknesses; not the privacy of today.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Epiville SARS outbreak</h1>

<p>Walk through the exercise and have students answer the question.</p>

<h3>Why Influenza?</h3>

<p>Influenza kills more people in the US than any other infectious disease, including HIV.  This involves a combination of transmissibility, ability to evade the immune system, and therefore potential lethality.</p>

<p>Why is the influenza virus so successful.</p>

<ul>
<li>Structure of viruses and their rapid mutability.  They don&#39;t have to do anything much on their own, so they can afford to mutate, and still get replicated.</li>
<li>Two main components that interact with receptors on the cell surface: 

<ul>
<li>hemagglutinin which binds to sialic acid receptor</li>
<li>neuraminidase which breaks up the sialic acid remaining on the cell surface to keep the escaping viruses from binding to the cell.  H1N1 coding scheme.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RNA leads to rapid mutation.</li>
<li>Reassortment &mdash; since there are several different gene segments in the virus &mdash; leads to the possibility of mixing genes from different viruses.  Pigs have sialic acid receptors that can bind to both bird viruses and mammalian viruses, providing a means for reassortment. (Some claim that human cells can provide a means for combining, too.)</li>
<li>p 105-6  &ldquo;The influenza virus mutates so fast that 99 percent of the 100,000 to 1 milion new viruses that burst out of a cell in the reproduction process are to defective to infect another cell and reproduce again.  But that still leaves between 1000 and 10,000 viruses that <em>can</em> infect another cell.&rdquo; &mdash; What&#39;s the reproduction time: around 10 hours.  Trace through the process over 2 days &mdash; what proportion of the body&#39;s cells can get infected.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Immune response</h3>

<ul>
<li>Capillaries must dilate to admit white blood cells.  How do you get them to dilate?  Fever?<br/>

<ul>
<li>Red blood cells are as big as a capillary: &ldquo;The size of erythrocytes varies widely among vertebrate species; erythrocyte width is on average about 25% larger than capillary diameter and it has been hypothesized that this improves the oxygen transfer from erythrocytes to tissues.&rdquo; &ldquo;A typical human erythrocyte has a disk diameter of approximately 6.2-8.2 µm[27] and a thickness at the thickest point of 2-2.5 µm and a minimum thickness in the centre of 0.8-1 µm, being much smaller than most other human cells.&rdquo;</li>
<li>White blood cell diameter, approx. 10 µm: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell">see table</a> Macrophages are 5 times larger.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Immune response to one influenza virus recalls the immune response to other varieties to which the body has previously been exposed.  Thus, a new virus tends to suppress the spread of old viruses. There tends to be a dominant form of virus in peak seasons and it&#39;s usually a relatively new form, to which many people have not yet been exposed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Population response</h3>

<ul>
<li>p. 114  Influenza pandemics generally infect from 15 to 40 percent of a population.  <strong>Why not more?</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1>Disease </h1>

<p>Classic epidemiological problem: account for an outbreak.</p>

<p>Basic tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>accounting for exposure and risk</li>
<li>time and space pattern of outbreak.  We&#39;re going to be focusing in this section particularly on the time pattern of an outbreak.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Epidemic Curves</h3>

<ul>
<li>Epidemic curve for a point-source epidemic.
<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Fig-12-4.png" alt="EE Figure 12.4 point-source"/></li>
<li>Epidemic curve for a propagative epidemic, in the early phases when the waves are still distinct. 
<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Fig-12-5.png" alt="EE Figure 12.5"/><br/></li>
<li>The Danish tuberculosis epidemic.
<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Fig-12-6.png" alt="EE Figure 12.6"/> </li>
<li>Conversion rate for students in different settings: 
<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Table-12-2.png" alt="EE Table 12.2"/></li>
<li>Long-term tracking of cases <img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Table-12-3.png" alt="EE Table 12.3"/></li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion of P-CAST Report</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/PCAST_H1N1_Report.pdf">The report</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Look at their scenario in Box 3A on page 19.  What are the assumptions that are going into it?  (Ten-fold increase every week, about half the population susceptible.  Sketch out the incidence, and the cumulative incidence curves.)</li>
<li>Page 2: &ldquo;In Australia, 11 percent of over 20,000 confirmed cases of 2009-H1N1 influenza have been hospitalized.  And of the 410 cases now hospitalized, 110 are in ICUs.&rdquo;  Why would it be misleading to say that &frac14; of hospitalized cases go to ICU.</li>
<li>Why was the initial case-fatality rate estimated in Mexico so high?</li>
<li>Note how they used an estimate to discover a bottle-neck &mdash; anticipating 50-100% of ICU capacity will be needed.  But no estimate of how long people will stay in the ICU.</li>
<li>What&#39;s the problem with a single go/no-go decision, which they identified as the problem in the 1975 swine-flu situtation?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Simulation of Infection Spread</h3>

<p>Hand out the <a href="Activities/spread-simulation.pdf">transmission tokens</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Students should separate the infection tokens and place them face down.<br/></li>
<li>I&#39;ll infect one student.  He or she should turn over a random token and infect that student.  That student passes along the infection in a similar way.</li>
<li>Repeat, but with each infective student using two tokens.</li>
<li>Repeat, but with three.</li>
<li>Herd immunity: three tokens but half the class is immune (as described by the immune/susceptible tokens)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Distribution of Diseases in Different Countries</h3>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Fig-12-1.png" alt="EE Figure 12.1"/><br/><br/>
A horrible, side-by-side pie chart graph.  Talk about how to make the graphic more effective.  The key principle is to bring adjacent the things that you want to compare.</p>

<h3>Outbreaks</h3>

<p>Different types of outbreaks: </p>

<ul>
<li>point source, limited time (food poisoning)</li>
<li>point source, environmental toxin (uranium mine tailings) &mdash; might show an increase as more people are exposed for more time</li>
<li>transmissible: endemic, epidemic, pandemic (enzootic, epizootic)</li>
</ul>
