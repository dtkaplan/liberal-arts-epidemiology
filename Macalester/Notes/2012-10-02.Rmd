Epiville SARS outbreak
====================
Walk through the exercise and have students answer the question.

### Why Influenza?

Influenza kills more people in the US than any other infectious disease, including HIV.  This involves a combination of transmissibility, ability to evade the immune system, and therefore potential lethality.

Why is the influenza virus so successful.
* Structure of viruses and their rapid mutability.  They don't have to do anything much on their own, so they can afford to mutate, and still get replicated.
* Two main components that interact with receptors on the cell surface: 
    * hemagglutinin which binds to sialic acid receptor
    * neuraminidase which breaks up the sialic acid remaining on the cell surface to keep the escaping viruses from binding to the cell.  H1N1 coding scheme.
* RNA leads to rapid mutation.
* Reassortment --- since there are several different gene segments in the virus --- leads to the possibility of mixing genes from different viruses.  Pigs have sialic acid receptors that can bind to both bird viruses and mammalian viruses, providing a means for reassortment. (Some claim that human cells can provide a means for combining, too.)
* p 105-6  "The influenza virus mutates so fast that 99 percent of the 100,000 to 1 milion new viruses that burst out of a cell in the reproduction process are to defective to infect another cell and reproduce again.  But that still leaves between 1000 and 10,000 viruses that *can* infect another cell." --- What's the reproduction time: around 10 hours.  Trace through the process over 2 days --- what proportion of the body's cells can get infected.


### Immune response

* Capillaries must dilate to admit white blood cells.  How do you get them to dilate?  Fever?  
    * Red blood cells are as big as a capillary: "The size of erythrocytes varies widely among vertebrate species; erythrocyte width is on average about 25% larger than capillary diameter and it has been hypothesized that this improves the oxygen transfer from erythrocytes to tissues." "A typical human erythrocyte has a disk diameter of approximately 6.2-8.2 µm[27] and a thickness at the thickest point of 2-2.5 µm and a minimum thickness in the centre of 0.8-1 µm, being much smaller than most other human cells."
    * White blood cell diameter, approx. 10 µm: [see table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell) Macrophages are 5 times larger.
* Immune response to one influenza virus recalls the immune response to other varieties to which the body has previously been exposed.  Thus, a new virus tends to suppress the spread of old viruses. There tends to be a dominant form of virus in peak seasons and it's usually a relatively new form, to which many people have not yet been exposed.

### Population response

* p. 114  Influenza pandemics generally infect from 15 to 40 percent of a population.  **Why not more?**


Disease 
==========

Classic epidemiological problem: account for an outbreak.

Basic tools:
* accounting for exposure and risk
* time and space pattern of outbreak.  We're going to be focusing in this section particularly on the time pattern of an outbreak.

### Epidemic Curves

* Epidemic curve for a point-source epidemic.
![EE Figure 12.4 point-source](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Fig-12-4.png)
* Epidemic curve for a propagative epidemic, in the early phases when the waves are still distinct. 
![EE Figure 12.5](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Fig-12-5.png)   
* The Danish tuberculosis epidemic.

* Conversion rate for students in different settings:

* Long-term tracking of cases ![EE Table 12.3](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Figures/EE-Table-12-3.png)

### Discussion of P-CAST Report

[The report](http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/PCAST_H1N1_Report.pdf).

* Look at their scenario in Box 3A on page 19.  What are the assumptions that are going into it?  (Ten-fold increase every week, about half the population susceptible.  Sketch out the incidence, and the cumulative incidence curves.)
* Page 2: "In Australia, 11 percent of over 20,000 confirmed cases of 2009-H1N1 influenza have been hospitalized.  And of the 410 cases now hospitalized, 110 are in ICUs."  Why would it be misleading to say that 1/4 of hospitalized cases go to ICU.
* Why was the initial case-fatality rate estimated in Mexico so high?
* Note how they used an estimate to discover a bottle-neck --- anticipating 50-100% of ICU capacity will be needed.  But no estimate of how long people will stay in the ICU.
* What's the problem with a single go/no-go decision, which they identified as the problem in the 1975 swine-flu situtation?

### Simulation of Infection Spread

Hand out the [transmission tokens](Activities/spread-simulation.pdf)
* Students should separate the infection tokens and place them face down.  
* I'll infect one student.  He or she should turn over a random token and infect that student.  That student passes along the infection in a similar way.
* Repeat, but with each infective student using two tokens.
* Repeat, but with three.
* Herd immunity: three tokens but half the class is immune (as described by the immune/susceptible tokens)


### Distribution of Diseases in Different Countries

A horrible, side-by-side pie chart graph.  Talk about how to make the graphic more effective.  The key principle is to bring adjacent the things that you want to compare.

### Outbreaks

Different types of outbreaks: 
* point source, limited time (food poisoning)
* point source, environmental toxin (uranium mine tailings) --- might show an increase as more people are exposed for more time
* transmissible: endemic, epidemic, pandemic (enzootic, epizootic)
