Today's Theme: Continuing with Precision and Accuracy
---------------------

One way to think about accuracy is in terms of bias.  The book describes several forms of sampling bias.  

Examples:

* How many of you are intravenous drug users?
* How many of you support Romney?

Other examples:
* In traditional telephone polls, respondants are more likely to be democratic.
* In mail (SPO) polls at Macalester, females are much more likely to respond.
* Recall bias: people tend to think they ate more healthily.  Cruciferous vegetables and tomatoes interaction in Queensland study of meat cooking and prostate cancer.

**Example**: Longevity of patients with Alzheimers.  Sampling method: Go to nursing homes, find the Alzheimer's patients, follow their records to get the time of onset, then track through death.

Ways to avoid bias.  We'll do two questions:

* Do you support Romney?
* Have you smoked marijuana since the semester started.
If the answer is yes, add 1 to the count and pass it along.

Another bias: publication bias.  We don't published "failed" studies.

Precision
-------------
Review confidence intervals.  



Review p-values.

P-value activity

P-value is not an estimate of effect size.  It's a way of winnowing out accidental results.

Sample Size
------------

How big does your study need to be?  Do a preliminary study and estimate the confidence interval.  Increase the sample size until the confidence interval no longer touches the null hypothesis value.  This will give a power of 50%.  For a power of 75%, increase the sample size more until it reaches only about half-way to the null hypothesis value. 

Funnel plots and p-values.

### Power
How big would the study need to be to keep the confidence intervals well away from log odds of 0.

Confounding
---------------

Examples ...

### Made up example from the book.  ("Imagine a (very small) case-control study ...")

### Life vests and drowning

Coast guard study during Carter administration.  Is it cost-effective to have a government regulation requiring life vests on passenger ships.  Go to records of man-overboard and look at the fraction who drowned with and without life vests.

          | Drowned    | Saved
----------|------------|----------------
Vest      |    71      |   29
No Vest   |    29      |   71

Odds Ratio: 6:1

95% confidence interval: 3.2 to 11.2

So the result is precise enough, even if it's based only on 100 cases.

But there is a confounder.

Sea State | With Vests | Without Vests
----------|------------|----------------
Calm      |   1/10     |  20/90
High Waves|   70/90    |  9/10
TOTAL     |   71/100   | 29/100

### Smoking and Death

Study of female voters in Whickhamshire, England.  Interviewed voters and recorded whether or not they smoked.  Followed up 20-years later to see who was still alive.  Here are the data.

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,results="hide"}
require(mosaic,quietly=TRUE)
```

```{r}
w = fetchData("whickham.csv")
with(w, table(smoker,outcome ))
502*139/(443*230)
```

What does this odds ratio mean?  Keep in mind that the odds ratio refers to a particular layout of the table, with exposed in the top row and cases in the left column.  This has that backwards.  So the odds ratio of 0.68 means that smoker "No" is associated with low probability of being "Alive".

Easier to interpret if we put the columns and rows in the conventional order.  Then OR > 1 means "exposure is associated with case status".  In other words, smoker is associated with lower probability of dying.

We can ask for a confidence interval on this odds ratio
```{r}
exp( log(.6848)+c(-2,2)*sqrt(1/502+1/230+1/443+1/139))
```

Therefore, we have a statistically significant protective value of smoking on dying.

But there is a confounder: age

### Charter Schools

Research into whether charter schools provide superior outcomes to public schools.

Method: Lottery randomly assigned applicants to charter schools or to remain in public schools.  Standardized tests used to compare the charter school kids to the public school controls.  

Findings: No difference in performance ... except when stratified by race: African-Americans did better in charter schools than in public schools.

Why?  Maybe more favorable/tolerant environment in charter schools.  Maybe better discipline/uniforms, etc.  But actually ... the researchers didn't find any evidence for this.

Most charter schools are Catholic.  Most African Americans are not Catholic.  So African-American applicants tended to be coming from worse public schools than Hispanic or white applicants.

### Voting on the Civil Rights Act


A real-life example is the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Overall, a larger fraction of Republican legislators voted in favor of the Act than Democrats. 

In the House: 80% of Republicans versus 61% of Democrats

In the Senate: 82% of Republicans versus 69% of Democrats

However,  when the congressional delegations from the northern and southern states are considered separately,  a larger fraction of Democrats voted in favor of the act in both regions. This arose because regional affiliation is a very strong indicator of how a congressman or senator voted, but party affiliation is a weak indicator. 

#### House Voting on the Civil Rights Act
 
 Region |  Democrat |    | Republican  |
--------|-----------|----|-------------|----
Northern | 94% | (145/154) | 85% | (138/162)
Southern | 7%  | (7/94)     | 0% | (0/10)
Both     | 61% | (152/248) | 80% | (138/172)


#### Senate Voting on the Civil Rights Act

 Senate | Democrat | . | Republican| .
--------|----------|---|-----------|--- 
Northern|98% |(45/46)| 84% |(27/32)
Southern|5% |(1/21)  | 0% | (0/1)
Both    | 69% |(46/67) | 82% |(27/33)


Berkeley Gender Bias Case
------------------

#### Admitted Applicants

Sex   | Number Admitted | Fraction admitted
------|-----------------|------------------
Men   | 8442            | 44%
Women | 4321            | 35%


However when examining the individual departments, it was found that no department was significantly biased against women. In fact, most departments had a "small but ''statistically significant bias'' in favor of women."  The data from the six largest departments is listed below.

Department  | Men | .  |  Women |  .
------------|-----|----|--------|--------
            | Applicants | Admitted | Applicants | Admitted
 A          | 825        | 62%      | 108        | 82%
 B          | 560        | 63%      | 25         | 68%
 C          | 325        | 37%      | 593        | 34%
 D          | 417        | 33%      | 375        | 35%
 E          | 191        | 28%      | 393        | 24%
 F          | 272        | 6%       | 341        | 7%

Criteria for a variable being a confounder
----------------------

* a risk factor for the disease among those not exposed to the factor of interest.
* associated with the exposure of interest
* not an intermediate between exposure and outcome.

Dealing with Confounding
------------------------

### At Study Design Phase

* Randomization : experimental assignment
* Restriction : only allow in participants who have the same level of the confounding variable
* Matching : make the controls specifically similar to the cases


### At Data Analysis Phase

* Stratification (this is what we will do)
* Multivariate modeling (this is what is done in Math 155)
* Instrumental Variables (Intent to treat)
* Propensity score (probability of being given treatment based on covariates) --- match or stratify based on the propensity score

#### Figure from EE.

Quick summary is easier: Use strata-specific OR or the adjusted OR if the strata are similar.
