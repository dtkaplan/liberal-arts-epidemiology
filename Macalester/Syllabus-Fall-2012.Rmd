   * The CTV blurb is pretty accurate:

> Based on true events and bolstered by extensive research with medical experts, Plague City brings to television the stories of the actual heroes of the SARS crisis: the many health care workers who risked their lives on a daily basis caring for sick and dying patients. At the same time, the CTV movie underscores the struggle of Toronto's public health officials and politicians as they attempted to control the quickly spreading disease, suppress the rising public panic and mitigate the devastating economic repercussions.

**Topic**: Wrapping up the spread of epidemics.  The statistics of confidence intervals.

**Reading**: 
* Atul Gawande, *Better*: "On Washing Up" and "The Mop Up"
* The *Great Influenza* through p. 195

**Assignment**: 
* Hand in a short sample spreadsheet of data for your *Island* project.  Each group should submit just one spreadsheet, printed on paper, with the names of all members of the group.  Then wait for approval from Prof. Kaplan before continuing to collect your whole set of data.
* An [interactive tutorial on confidence intervals](http://www.usablestats.com/tutorials/CI).
It's surprisingly difficult to find good reading materials on confidence intervals. They are quite simple, but somehow the exposition gets tied up in statistical detail and formulas. This tutorial is not connected to formulas, but doesn't explain **why** things are the way they are.  

I welcome proposals for skits to be made into short videos that would explain things in a fun and informative way to a general audience.

**Topic**: Catch up. MID-TERM EXAM (second 45 minutes of class)

**[Examples of Exam Questions](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Epi-Mid-Term-Review-Collection.pdf)** These questions will give you a feel for the style of the questions likely to be asked on the exam.  Answers are given [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Epi-Mid-Term-Review-Collection-F2012-with-answers.pdf)

**Study Guide for Exam**. In addition to the vocabulary and concepts, you'll be expected to be able to do certain calculations that we have done in class:

* Life expectancy
* Odds ratio and interpretation of confidence intervals
* Prevalence/Incidence
* Relative Risk and Attributable Fraction

In reviewing these calculations, go through the following end-of-chapter problems from the Essential Epidemiology textbook:
* Chapter 2: Probs 1 and 2
* Chapter 5: Probs 1, 2, 3, and 4

A calculation problem on the test will be drawn from these very problems. You'll find answers to the problems in the back of the textbook. For life-expectancy calculations, review Appendix 5 from the book.
