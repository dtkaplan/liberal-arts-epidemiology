The association of smoking with coronary heart disease (CHD) is investigated by selecting for study a group of 3,000 smokers and a group of 5,000 non-smokers.  Both groups are free of disease at baseline.  Both groups are followed for the development of CHD.

Among cigarette smokers, 84 individuals develop CHD.  Among non-smokers, 87 develop CHD.
