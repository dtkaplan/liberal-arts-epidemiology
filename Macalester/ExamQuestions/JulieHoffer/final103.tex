A physical examination and an audiometric test were given to 500 persons with suspected hearing problems, of whom 300 were actually found to have them.  The results of the examinations were as follows:

\medskip

\centerline{\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\multicolumn{3}{c}{PHYSICAL EXAMINATION}\\
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Hearing Problems}\\
Result	& Present	& Absent\\\hline
Positive &	240&	    40\\
Negative&	60 &	   160\\
\end{tabular}}

Result	& Present	& Absent\\\hline
Positive	& 270 &	    60\\
Negative	& 30	&   140\\
\end{tabular}}
