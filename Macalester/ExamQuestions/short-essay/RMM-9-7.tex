%% Topic: Causation

Kenneth Rothman developed a causal model in which the factors contributing to a given health-related state or event are represented by pieces of a pie, with the entire pie making up a sufficient cause for the health outcome.  The health-related state or event may have more than one sufficient cause, with each sufficient cause consisting of multiple contributing factors that are called component causes (represented by the pieces of the pie).  For example, component causes A, B, and C may be sufficient to cause a disease, but component causes A, D, and E may also be sufficient to cause the disease.  In this case, A is necessary because it is required in each of the sufficient causes.  Choose {\bf one}  of the following conditions and draw the Rothman ``pies'' for the condition.  (You don't have to give an absolutely complete list of  component causes, just enough to show that you have a good understanding of the condition and some of the causal components.)
