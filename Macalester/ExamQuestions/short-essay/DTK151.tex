Here's a news report from Dec. 13, 2011:
\begin{quotation}
A federal agency on Tuesday called for a ban on all cellphone use by drivers --- the most far-reaching such recommendation to date --- saying its decision was based on a decade of investigations into distraction-related accidents, as well as growing concerns that powerful mobile devices are giving drivers even more reasons to look away from the road.

As part of its recommendation, the National Transportation Safety Board is urging states to ban drivers from using hands-free devices, including wireless headsets. No state now outlaws such activity, but the board said that drivers faced serious risks from talking on wireless headsets, just as they do by taking a hand off the wheel to hold a phone to their ear.  --- New York {\em Times}

Suppose you are working for a Congressional committee that is looking into the NTSB recommendation.  You've been tasked to carry out a study, in the next 30 days, of how dangerous ``hands-free'' devices are for driving.  You have reasonable authority to collect data from various governmental sources, state, local, and federal, and from the records of cell-phone companies.  Provide an outline for the study you will conduct, using both technical language and interpreting things in a manner that your congressmen bosses can understand.
