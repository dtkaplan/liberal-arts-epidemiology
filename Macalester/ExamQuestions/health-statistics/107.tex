Assume that the prevalence of coronary heart disease decreases after
age 70, but its incidence continues to increase with age.  What is the
most probable explanation for the divergence of these rates?

\begin{AnswerText}
Since prevalence is incidence times duration, one way to reduce the
prevalence is to reduce the duration.  So, the decrease in prevalence
in the presence of an increase in incidence signals a decrease in
duration.  Older people survive less time after getting CHD than
younger people.
