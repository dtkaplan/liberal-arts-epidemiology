A random sample of middle-age sedentary males was selected from four
census tracts, and each man was examined for coronary artery disease.
All those having the disease were excluded from the study.  All others
were randomly assigned to either an exercise group, allowed a 2-year
program of systematic exercise, or to a control group which had no
exercise program.  Both groups were observed semiannually for any
difference in incidence of coronary artery disease.
