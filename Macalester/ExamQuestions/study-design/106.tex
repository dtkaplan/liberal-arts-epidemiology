Adenocarcinoma of the vagina in young women had rarely been recorded
before the report of eight cases at the Vincent Memorial Hospital,
Boston, between 1966 and 1969.  The unusual occurrence of this tumor
in eight patients born in New England hospitals between 1946 and 1951
led to an investigation.  Attention was particularly directed at a
history of maternal ingestion of estrogens during the pregnancy that
resulted in the patient with vaginal adenocarcinoma.

What type of epidemiological study would be appropriate for this
problem, and why?
