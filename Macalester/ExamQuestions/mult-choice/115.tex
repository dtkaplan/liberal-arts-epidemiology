In Los Angeles, public health authorities identified 100 people with disease X.  These cases came from 40 affected households with 230 people.  Assuming that each household had only one primary case and that each primary case attended a local daycare center, what is the secondary attack rate?
\begin{MultipleChoice}[itemname=II-10]
\correct{32\%}
\wrong{17\%}
\wrong{43\%}
\wrong{67\%}
\end{MultipleChoice}

\begin{AnswerText}
There were 40 primary cases, leaving $230 - 40 = 190$ people
susceptible.  Assuming that, of the 100 cases, all but the 40 primary
cases are secondary cases (the problem statement gives no choice but
to make this assumption), then the secondary attack rate is $60/190 = 32$\%.
