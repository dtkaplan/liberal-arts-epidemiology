Causal inference is often based on selected criteria such as those
proposed by Austin Bradford Hill.

\centerline{\begin{tabular}{lcl}
1 & & Temporality\\
2 & & Strength of association\\
3 & & Consistency of association\\
4 & & Specificity\\
5 & & Biological gradient\\
6 & & Biological plausibility\\
7 & & Coherence\\
8 & & Analogy\\
9 & & Experimental evidence\\
\end{tabular}}

For each of these statements, match one of the nine criteria:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Similar results are found by different researchers using
  different methods. \SelectSetHoriz{3}{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
\item An exposure is associated with only one disease or the disease
  is associated with only one exposure. \SelectSetHoriz{4}{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
\item Valid statistical association between an exposure and health
  outcome variable. \SelectSetHoriz{2}{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
\item Ethics and feasibility often limit application of this criterion
  is human populations. \SelectSetHoriz{9}{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
\item A time sequence of events is established. \SelectSetHoriz{1}{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
\item Dose-response relationship. \SelectSetHoriz{5}{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
\end{enumerate}
