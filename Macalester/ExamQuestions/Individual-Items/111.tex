The outbreak of an illness among football players and coaches is hypothesized to be associated with a person's location --- the north versus the south wing --- in an athletic training center.   Each player and coach was asked where he was practicing, resulting in the following $2 \times 2$ table. 

\medskip
\centerline{\begin{tabular}{lrr}
& \multicolumn{2}{c}{Illness}\\
Location & Yes & No\\\hline
South & 25 & 13\\
North & 5 & 15\\
\end{tabular}}
\medskip

Use an appropriate measure to calculate the association between location and illness.
