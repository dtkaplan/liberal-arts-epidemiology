A screening test for a newly discovered disease is being evaluated.  In order to determine the effectiveness of the new test, it was administered to 900 workers.

150 of the individuals diagnosed with the disease tested positive.  A negative test finding occurred in 60 people who had the disease.  A total of 50 persons not diseased tested positive for it.
