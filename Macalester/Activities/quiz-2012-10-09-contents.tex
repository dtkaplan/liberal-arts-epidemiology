In answering the ``Did you read?" questions, select an answer from one of these, or something equally detailed.


\begin{itemize}
\item I didn't even know about it. 
\item Didn't look at it.  
\item Skimmed it. 
\item Read quickly. 
\item Read thoroughly.
\item Read and reviewed.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Did you read ``On Washing Hands"? 

\item Did you read ``The Mop Up"?

\item If you did both of the readings, say briefly what, if anything, you took away from the readings that is significant to you.

If you did not, say what you and I could do to help you to do these short readings. Don't be shy.  We're trying to be effective here, not socially adept.

\item Did you read the first section of the assigned reading from ``The Great Influenza," the ``Tinderbox"?

\item Did you read the second section of the assigned reading from ``The Great Influenza," called ``It Begins."

These are longer readings and, while still not technical, not as easy as the readings in Atul Gawande's ``Better."  

\item If you did the readings, say what, if anything, you took away that is significant to you.

If you did not, give some suggestions for how I could arrange the readings to help you to do them?  

\end{enumerate}
